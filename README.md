 WeatherSync - Realtime weather tracking Dashboard
ðŸŒ¦ WeatherSync â€” Weather Forecast App

Elevo Pathways | Front-End Web Developer Internship | Task 4


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

WeatherSync is a weather forecast application developed as part of Task 4 of my Elevo Pathways Front-End Web Developer Internship.
The goal of this project was to build a real-time weather app that fetches weather data dynamically and displays it in a clean, responsive UI.

Users can:

Search for weather in any city

View temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions

Experience an interactive, mobile-friendly design


This project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs and create dynamic front-end applications.
